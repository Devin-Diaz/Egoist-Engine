OVERVIEW:

Getting setup with project. We will use React, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Python to complete this project.
The goal of Blue Lock Index is to show the teams and players of each arc. We will be doing the following arcs:
	- First Selection
	- Second Selection
	- World 5
	- Third Selection
	- U20 Match
	- Neo Egoist League

To begin building this application we of course need... DATA! Unfortnuately I couldn't find an API to make this
process easy so we will result to web scraping utilizing Python. The following is the link to where I will be 
getting my data. 

LINK: https://bluelock.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Characters

Schema will be designed as the following:
	
	PLAYER:
		- Player Id (PRIM KEY)
		- Full name
		- Age
		- Height
		- Nationality
		- Image url

	ARC:
 		- Arc Id (PRIM KEY)
		- Arc name
	
	TEAM:
		- Team Id (PRIM KEY)
		- Arc Id (FOREIGN KEY)
		- Team name

	PLAYER STATS:
		- Stat Id (PRIM KEY)
		- Player Id (FOREIGN KEY)
		- Arc Id (FOREIGN KEY)
		- Team Id (FOREIGN KEY)
		- Position
		- Rank
		- Jersey number
		- Weapons

Only slight question raised will be the second selection since there is to many teams due to the mini games in 
that arc. So there will be a lot of NULL values as no teams will be specified only PLAYER, ARC, STATS, would
be specified.

WEB DATA SCRAPING:

We will be utilizing the BeautifulSoup library from python to be scraping data via the html/xml of the page. This is where
the first complication comes in. 

	Our data has profiles for each of the character for each arc. So before collecting actual
	player data, we must scrape all references that point to the page of their actual profile. 
	We will make a function that collects all hrefs for each player component.

	Once we have all the hrefs for each player, we will iterate through each and parse out data needed.
	Once data is parsed and stored in proper data structure we will convert it into csv file as we will
	need these files to transfer data to a dbms seamlessly is that even a word bruh.

	Arc and Team data will be manually written as there is not that many entries. These will also be converted
	to csv files. Recall we use pandas library to do this action. 

	Lastly we need the player arc data. I will import my manually written data to assist with this ensuring I pair
	the foreign key data correctly. For player data I'll read my csv file. This will be a little tricky as a lot
	of players have played on multiple teams and been in more than one arcs. Additionally I need to figure out the
	player weapon aspect. For example Isagi didn't get metavision until he was on Bastard Munchen. I feel like
	that can be manually adjusted, but we shall see.
